# Porfolio website for an artist

This website is a onpage application to introduce the artist and display the works of art as a portfolio.

It uses a mock API to display each work through react-router-dom and .map on a different page.

## Tecnologies and packages

The initialization of the project was with vite, using "npm create vite@latest" and the React template.

Also used "npm install react-router-hash-link" to create the navbar with achor text.

Used "npm install @emailjs/browser" to connect the form with the email service.

For the styles: used the BEM methodology and the SASS processor.

The animations on the gallery used AOS (Animate on scroll library) "npm install aos"

To improve the visualization of the code, used eslint linter and prettier formatter

## Future dependencies

The backend will be created to be able to navigate the different pages through shared links.

It will be linked to a database so that the client can upload their future works
